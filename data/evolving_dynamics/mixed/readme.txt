90k iterations x 10 simulations
dynamics order ('s' for springs, 'c' for charged) -> ['s', 'c', 'c', 's', 'c', 's', 'c', 's', 's', 'c'] 
interaction graph changes each simulation (agent location and velocity are not initialized each simulation)
interaction strength in each simulation: 
    (springs) 0.1
    (charged) 1.0
